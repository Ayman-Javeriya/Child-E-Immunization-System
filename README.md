# Child E-Immunization-System
Child E Immunization System (For Anganwadi) was a mini project on the subject Data Base and Management systems (DBMS). Where the first priority was to show the maximum use of the database.

The main focus of our application was to give the vaccines to children on time and maintain a record in the database which will help to access the data quickly.
The Application will also send Email Notification prior to the parents, so that child will get vaccination on time.s

As we know that Anganwadi is still maintaining its records manually, as per the Government of Maharashtra there is a total of 86,31,910 children going to Anganwadi. And government assistants still maintain the records manually, which is time-consuming.

In future, we are thinking to create a mobile application instead of desktop application so that Government doesn't need to provide Computer to each Anganwadi.
